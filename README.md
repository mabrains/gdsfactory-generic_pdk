## Introduction

The generic open source PDK is a collaboration between Mabrains and Gdsfactory to provide a fully open source process design kit (PDK) and related resources to enable the creation of photonic designs manufacturable.


## Current-Status

> :warning: We are currently treating the current content as an **experimental preview!**

The PDK will be tagged with a production version when ready to do production design.

## Generic-PDK

This repository contains the full pdk inspired from Gdsfactory generic technology.


This includes: (Future)


 * Schematic symbols
 * DRC
 * LVS
 * Pcells

 Currently it supports;

  * For Schematic:
     - xschem
  * For DRC:
     - Klayout
  * For LVS:
     - Klayout
  * For Pcells:
     - Klayout

## **Prerequisites**

At a minimum:

- Python 3.10+
- Gdsfactory 7.9.2+
- Klayout 0.28.12+

<!-- TODO : Adding requirements file for required python packages -->
